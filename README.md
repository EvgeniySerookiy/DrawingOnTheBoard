<h1 align="left"> Drawing On The Board</h1>
<h2 align="leftr">Description</h2>
<p align="leftr">The drawing process takes place on the board. We have 6 colors at our disposal, as well as an sponge for cleaning. To draw something, we select the desired color and click on it. The square near the cursor is painted in the selected color, and we draw with this color. The mechanic is such that we must hold down the left mouse button and draw. Then, if we want to change the color or erase everything from the board, we must release the left mouse button and click on the desired color or the eraser for clearing.</p>
